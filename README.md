You are a Data Scientist working for the World Health Organization (WHO). Due to the
outbreak of 2019-nCoV, WHO is alerted to several cases of pneumonia and wants to know
how this virus will affect the population, specifically whether the Healthcare System in place is
capable of addressing this issue. Therefore, you are asked to predict next 7-days 2019-nCoV
cumulative Confirmed, Infected, Recovered, Death cases using Linear Regression Model.
